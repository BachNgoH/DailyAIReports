* **Addressing the challenges of long documents and data distribution shifts:** New methods are being proposed for long document classification, robust task selection for meta-learning, and improving the generalization abilities of neural architecture search under distribution shifts.
* **Exploring the potential of diffusion models:** Diffusion models are being investigated as probabilistic neural operators for recovering unobserved states of dynamical systems and for large-scale factor remote sensing image super-resolution.
* **Emphasis on interpretability and explainability:** Researchers are developing methods for interpreting global minima of deep ReLU neural networks, auditing automatic grading models, and designing human-centered explanations for graph neural networks.
* **Addressing bias and fairness in AI systems:** Studies are being conducted to understand and mitigate nationality bias in LLMs and to develop fair graph representation learning methods.
* **Advancements in computer vision and image processing:** New methods are being proposed for CT metal artifact reduction, blurry image super-resolution with events, and efficient real-world image super-resolution.
* **Improving the performance of time series prediction:** Researchers are exploring the use of reservoir kernel motif space, adaptive online Bayesian estimation of frequency distributions with local differential privacy, and rotary position embedding-based transformer Hawkes process.
